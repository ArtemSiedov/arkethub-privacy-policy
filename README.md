Last Updated: June 26, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how MarketHub - ChromeExtension ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the extension.

1. Data Collection and Usage

We take your privacy very seriously. MarketHub - ChromeExtension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive user data.

2. Locally Stored Data (chrome.storage)

To provide a consistent user experience, the extension uses the chrome.storage API. This functionality is used solely to save your settings locally on your computer. This data includes:

The state of user interface elements, such as checkboxes.
This data is stored only on your local machine, is never transmitted to any external server, and is not accessible to anyone other than you.

3. Content Script Data Handling

The extension's content script runs on https://gomer.rozetka.company/gomer/items/* pages. Its purpose is to read the page's structure (using XPath) to provide its features directly on the page. This data is processed in real-time and is not saved, stored, or transmitted off your computer.
